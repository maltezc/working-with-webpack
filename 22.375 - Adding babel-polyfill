Adding babel-polyfill
Section 22, Lecture 375
The current setup won't support all browsers theoretically
supported by React. Features like Promises and Object.assign()
are missing in older browsers - especially in IE of course.

If you need to support these browsers, you need to add a polyfill
(a package which provides these features for older browsers). babel-polyfill
is a great and easy-to-use choice.

Add it like this:

npm install --save babel-polyfill

Add the following import to the top of your index.js file:

import 'babel-polyfill';
Change the config of your env  babel preset in the .babelrc  file:

"presets": [
    ["env", {
        "targets": {
            "browsers": [
                "> 1%",
                "last 2 versions"
            ]
        },
        "useBuiltIns": "entry"
     }],
     "stage-2",
     "react"
 ],
useBuiltIns  was added and by setting it to 'entry' ,
the import in the index.js  file (import 'babel-polyfill' )
is actually changed to import whatever features need to be supported
for your chosen browsers and environment. More information can be found
